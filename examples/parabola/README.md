# Example 1: Throwing parabola with friction.
This example demonstrates how to use Cyantities to connect Python quantities
with a C++ numerics backend that uses Boost Units.

## Build
This example is a simple, self-contained script ([run.py](run.py)). For this
reason, the C++ code is built and copied to this current directory, allowing
the execution of [run.py](run.py) as a one-shot simulation.

To build the code, simply run
```bash
python build.py
```
in this directory (with prerequisites numpy, cyantities, meson, ? installed).


## Execute
To run the simulation after building,
```
python run.py
```
This simulates a ball comparable to a baseball being thrown at professional
speeds in a 45Â° angle with air friction, and writes the resulting trajectory
to a `result.pdf` file (requires matplotlib).


## Layout
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to build a C++ numerics code
interfaced by Cyantities.

There are three source files for the binary extension: `parasolve.pyx`,
`parasolve.hpp`, and `parasolve.cpp`. These reflect the typical minimum of
source files (more C++ sources would probably exist). The `meson.build` file
illustrates how these sources can be compiled into a Python extension.

The `build.py` script is a simple build script that uses Meson to compile
the `parasolve` extension, and subsequently copies the built extension to
this root folder. Since this example aims to mimic a specialized scientific
simulation, that is typically executed for one purpose only, the whole
layout is kept simple and based on everything being available in this
root directory and controlled by the `run.py` control script.

### Cyantities includes
The
[subprojects/cyantities/meson.build](subprojects/cyantities/meson.build)
blueprint Meson build file takes care of the discovery of the Cyantities
headers and provides a Meson requirement. It can simply be copied to
Meson-based projects to include and link to Cyantities.
